#		of real-valued attributes.  {\it Computational Intelligence}, {\it 5},
#		51--57.
#		-- Predicted price of car using all numeric and Boolean attributes
#		-- Method: an instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm derived from a
#		localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm.  Compared with a
#		linear regression prediction...so all instances
#		with missing attribute values were discarded.  This resulted with
#		a training set of 159 instances, which was also used as a test
#		set (minus the actual instance during testing).
#		-- Results: Percent Average Deviation Error of Prediction from Actual
#		-- 11.84% for the IBL algorithm
#		-- 14.12% for the resulting linear regression equation
#		
#		4. Relevant Information:
#		-- Description
#		This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the
#		specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b)
#		its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use
#		as compared to other cars.  The second rating corresponds to the
#		degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates.
#		Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its
#		price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is
#		adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this
#		process "symboling".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is
#		risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
#		
#		The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured
#		vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a
#		particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,
#		sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car
#		per year.
#		
#		-- Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a
#		"class" attribute.
