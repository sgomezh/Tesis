\title{
Build BART-CV
}
\description{
Builds a BART-CV model by cross-validating over a grid of hyperparameter choices.
}
\usage{
bartMachineCV(X = NULL, y = NULL, Xy = NULL, 
num_tree_cvs = c(50, 200), k_cvs = c(2, 3, 5), 
nu_q_cvs = NULL, k_folds = 5, verbose = FALSE, ...)

build_bart_machine_cv(X = NULL, y = NULL, Xy = NULL, 
num_tree_cvs = c(50, 200), k_cvs = c(2, 3, 5), 
nu_q_cvs = NULL, k_folds = 5, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
Data frame of predictors. Factors are automatically converted to dummies interally. 
}
  \item{y}{
Vector of response variable. If \code{y} is \code{numeric} or \code{integer}, a BART model for regression is built. If \code{y} is a factor with two levels, a BART model for classification is built.
}
  \item{Xy}{
A data frame of predictors and the response. The response column must be named ``y''. 
}
  \item{num_tree_cvs}{
Vector of sizes for the sum-of-trees models to cross-validate over.
}
  \item{k_cvs}{
Vector of choices for the hyperparameter \code{k} to cross-validate over.
}
  \item{nu_q_cvs}{
Only for regression. List of vectors containing (\code{nu}, \code{q}) ordered pair choices to cross-validate over. If \code{NULL}, then it defaults to the three values \code{list(c(3, 0.9), c(3, 0.99), c(10, 0.75))}.
}
  \item{k_folds}{
Number of folds for cross-validation
}
  \item{verbose}{
Prints information about progress of the algorithm to the screen. 
}
  \item{\dots}{
Additional arguments to be passed to \code{bartMachine}.
}
}

\value{
Returns an object of class ``bartMachine'' with the set of hyperparameters chosen via cross-validation. We also return a matrix ``cv_stats''
which contains the out-of-sample RMSE for each hyperparameter set tried and ``folds'' which gives the fold in which each observation fell across the k-folds.
